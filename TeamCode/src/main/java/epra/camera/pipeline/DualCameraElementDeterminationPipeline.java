         * Overview of what we're doing:
         *
         * We first convert to YCrCb color space, from RGB color space.
         * Why do we do this? Well, in the RGB color space, chroma and
         * luma are intertwined. In YCrCb, chroma and luma are separated.
         * YCrCb is a 3-channel color space, just like RGB. YCrCb's 3 channels
         * are Y, the luma channel (which essentially just a B&W image), the
         * Cr channel, which records the difference from red, and the Cb channel,
         * which records the difference from blue. Because chroma and luma are
         * not related in YCrCb, vision code written to look for certain values
         * in the Cr/Cb channels will not be severely affected by differing
         * light intensity, since that difference would most likely just be
         * reflected in the Y channel.
         *
         * For detecting team elements we extract both Cr and Cb channels.
         * The Cr channel is used to identify the red element and the Cb does the
         * same for the blue. If the Cr value is high, it is red, the same goes
         * for Cb and blue. We do not just use one channel because the inverse of red
         * in YCrCb is not blue, nor is red the opposite of red.
         *
         * We then take the average pixel value of 3 different regions on that Cb
         * channel, one positioned over potential location of the element. The brightest
         * of the 3 regions in blue or red is where the element is positioned. By
         * looking at the two channels and seeing which is brighter we can also identify
         * the color of the element, which may prove helpful.
         *
         * We also draw rectangles on the screen showing where the sample regions
         * are, as well as drawing a solid rectangle over top the sample region
         * we believe is on top of the element.
         *
         * In order for this whole process to work correctly, each sample region
         * should be positioned in the center of each of the potential locations, and
         * be small enough such that only the element is sampled, and not any of the
         * surroundings.
